# Usage: build_builder_base [--stage1-only]
# Effects:
#   1. Set the `builder_base_image` variable in the parent scope
#   2. Ensure that the `$builder_base_image` Docker image exists (pulling
#      it or building it if it doesn't).
#   3. (If $DEV_REGISTRY is set AND we built the image) push the
#      `$builder_base_image` Docker image.
#
# Description:
#
#   Rebuild (and push if DEV_REGISTRY is set) the builder's base image if
#    - `docker/base-python/Dockerfile` changes
#    - `requirements.txt` changes
#    - Enough time has passed (The base only has external/third-party
#      dependencies, and most of those dependencies are not pinned by
#      version, so we rebuild periodically to make sure we don't fall too
#      far behind and then get surprised when a rebuild is required for
#      Dockerfile changes.)  We have defined "enough time" as a few days.
#      See the variable "build_every_n_days" below.
#
#   The base theory of operation is that we generate a Docker tag name that
#   is essentially the tuple
#       (rounded_timestamp, hash("docker/base-python/Dockerfile"), hash("builder/requirements.txt")
#   then check that tag for existence/pullability using `docker run --rm
#   --entrypoint=true`; and build it if it doesn't exist and can't be
#   pulled.
#
#   OK, now for a wee bit of complexity.  We want to use `pip-compile` to
#   update `requirements.txt`.  Because of Python-version-conditioned
#   dependencies, we really want to run it with the image's python3, not
#   with the host's python3.  And since we're updating `requirements.txt`,
#   we don't really want the `pip install` to have already been run.  So,
#   we split the base image in to two stages; stage-1 is everything but
#   `COPY requirements.txt` / `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then
#   stage-2 copies in `requirements.txt` and runs the `pip install`.  In
#   normal operation we just go ahead and build both stages.  But if the
#   `--stage1-only` flag is given (as it is by the `pip-compile`
#   subcommand), then we only build the stage-1, and set the
#   `builder_base_image` variable to that.
